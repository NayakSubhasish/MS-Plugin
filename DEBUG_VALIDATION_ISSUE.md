# 🐛 DEBUG: Validation Dialog Issue

## 🎯 **CURRENT PROBLEM:**
- User clicks "Cancel" in validation dialog
- Email gets sent anyway (should be blocked)
- Next "Send" click doesn't show dialog again

## 🔍 **DEBUGGING STEPS:**

### **Step 1: Check if validation is triggered**
1. **Open Outlook** with the add-in
2. **Open Developer Console** (F12)
3. **Compose incomplete email**
4. **Click Send**
5. **Look for these logs:**
   ```
   🚀 Email validation triggered - OnMessageSend event fired
   🔧 validateEmail function loaded and called
   🎯 Event type: object
   🎯 Event completed function: function
   ```

### **Step 2: Check dialog response handling**
1. **When dialog appears, click "Cancel"**
2. **Look for these logs:**
   ```
   📥 Dialog response received: {"action":"cancel"}
   ❌ User cancelled - BLOCKING SEND
   🚫 Event completion with allowEvent: false
   🎯 About to call event.completed({ allowEvent: false })
   ✅ event.completed({ allowEvent: false }) called successfully
   ```

### **Step 3: Use debug commands**
**In console, run these commands:**

```javascript
// Check if validation is properly registered
checkValidationRegistration()

// Check current validation state
checkValidationState()

// Reset validation state if stuck
resetValidationState()

// Test validation manually
testValidation()

// Test event completion manually (simulate cancel)
testEventCompletion(false)

// Test event completion manually (simulate send anyway)
testEventCompletion(true)
```

## 🚨 **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:**

### **When Cancel is clicked:**
1. ✅ Dialog closes
2. ✅ `event.completed({ allowEvent: false })` is called
3. ✅ **Email should NOT be sent**
4. ✅ Next "Send" click should show dialog again

### **When Send Anyway is clicked:**
1. ✅ Dialog closes
2. ✅ `event.completed({ allowEvent: true })` is called
3. ✅ **Email should be sent**
4. ✅ Next incomplete email should show dialog again

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING:**

### **If validation doesn't trigger at all:**
1. **Check manifest registration:**
   - Look for `<Event Type="ItemSend" FunctionExecution="synchronous" FunctionName="validateEmail"/>`
2. **Reinstall add-in:**
   - Remove from Outlook
   - Re-add from manifest.xml
3. **Check commands.js loading:**
   - Verify commands.html includes `<script src="commands.js"></script>`

### **If validation triggers but email still sends after Cancel:**
1. **Check console for errors** in event.completed call
2. **Check if event object is valid** - look for `lastValidationEvent` in window
3. **Try manual event completion** - use `testEventCompletion(false)`

### **If dialog doesn't reappear:**
1. **Check validation state** - use `checkValidationState()`
2. **Reset state** - use `resetValidationState()`
3. **Check for stuck validation** - look for `validationInProgress: true`

## 🎯 **KEY DEBUG COMMANDS:**

```javascript
// 1. Check everything is working
checkValidationRegistration()

// 2. Check current state
checkValidationState()

// 3. See last event details
console.log(window.lastValidationEvent)

// 4. Reset if stuck
resetValidationState()

// 5. Test manually
testValidation()

// 6. Test event blocking manually
testEventCompletion(false) // Should block send
testEventCompletion(true)  // Should allow send
```

## 📊 **WHAT TO LOOK FOR:**

### **SUCCESS INDICATORS:**
- ✅ validateEmail function is called on Send
- ✅ Dialog appears for incomplete emails
- ✅ Cancel blocks the email (no send notification)
- ✅ Send Anyway allows the email (send notification appears)
- ✅ Dialog reappears on next Send of incomplete email

### **FAILURE INDICATORS:**
- ❌ validateEmail not called (manifest/registration issue)
- ❌ Dialog appears but Cancel doesn't block send (event.completed issue)
- ❌ Dialog doesn't reappear (state management issue)
- ❌ Console errors in event.completed calls
